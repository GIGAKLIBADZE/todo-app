## My process

I used different point of view when starting building of the project. I split off it in different components, then started to initialize each of them. For styling purposes here you can see Tailwind CSS. I built it with TypeScript. I used mobile first workflow. For summary, I changed my mindest for with React JS for the process of building.

### Built with

CSS custom properties
Flexbox

TypeScript
React JS

### What I learned

After creating some basic projects in React JS, I can confidently say that I am now familiar with the basics of this library. Now, I started learning of TypeScript and it is my first porject with this.. I plan to continue working on projects involving the React and TypeScript to deepen my understanding.
