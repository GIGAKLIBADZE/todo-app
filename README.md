## My process

I split the project into different components and initialized each of them. For styling, I used Styled-components for the first time and built the project with TypeScript, following a mobile-first workflow. I have now reached an advanced level in React.

### Built with

Semantic HTML5 markup
Mobile-first workflow
TypeScript
React JS
Styled Components

### What I learned

After creating some basic projects in React JS, I can confidently say that I am now familiar with some advanced concepts of this library. I have also deepened my knowledge of TypeScript, and this is my first project styled using Styled-components. I plan to continue working on projects involving React and TypeScript to further enhance my understanding.

### Continued development

Already, after building some of React JS projects, I am going to commence learning in it..
